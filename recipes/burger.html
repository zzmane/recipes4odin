    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Burger buns</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a griddle or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>While the griddle is heating, divide the ground beef into small, equal-sized portions (usually 2 to 4 ounces
            each).</li>
        <li>Season each portion with salt and pepper, shaping them loosely into balls.
        </li>
        <li>Place a ball of ground beef onto the hot griddle and immediately press it down with a spatula to create a
            thin patty.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 2-3 minutes until the bottom develops a nice crust. Flip the patty and cook for an additional
            2-3 minutes or until the desired level of doneness is reached.</li>
        <li>Optional: Add cheese on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking for a classic cheeseburger.</li>
        <li>Toast the burger buns on the griddle for a minute or until they are lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Assemble your smashed burgers with your favorite toppings and condiments.</li>
